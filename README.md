# Gamepad
*Bachelor thesis*

The aim of this thesis was to explore the possibilities of the Arduino controller to implement a gamepad with use of potentiometer. The reader is offered instructions for building his own gamepad from the hardware to the software part in this work, including a 3D case. 
Another intent of the work was to test the device on various games with target users/respondents and input lag testing.
